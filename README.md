# To-do-list
Why keep a TODO.md?
For a project, there any many sources of information like Documentation, Issue forum, Wiki pages, etc. It is hard to find out about the current progress.
Keeping a TODO.md file makes it easier for anyone who wants to know about the project's plans and work that needs to be done.

Why not using online management tools?
Often times, a new project starts with a list of tasks to outline what needs to be done quickly.
Although some online tools are useful to manage larger projects efficiently, using them in the early stages will add more effort and overhead for small projects.
A few other reasons like: portable plain text format, same project directory, offline working, privacy, versioning (using git), minimalist tool, etc.
